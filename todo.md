Ideas for better management of Soundness repositories:

(in no particular order)

- fix merino git-submodule
- Get Larceny compiling, built, and used as a plugin
- Build Java sources in `burdock`
- Fix all the remaining tests
- Add more submodules
- Publishing to Maven Central using Mill
- Merge `npcrus/soundness-monorepo` and `propensive/soundness`
- Experiment with discoverability
- scalafmt

lower priority:
- Build grouped `web`, `cli`, `data`, `base`, `dev`, `sci` binaries; maybe others
- Automate publish-on-tag from CI
- Use Mill in CI
- API Documentation
- Build and use Umbrageous for shading
- Start tracking code coverage
- Compile for Scala.JS (where possible)
