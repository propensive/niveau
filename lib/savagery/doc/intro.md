While applications like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) make it easy to
create vector graphics in SVG format, this approach is optimized for one-off
productions by graphic artists; it is not possible to create graphics
programmatically, dynamically or at scale from an input, for creating visual
languages or stylized diagrams. This is the role that _Savagery_ aims to fill.
