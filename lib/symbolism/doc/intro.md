Many different types support, in some way, the concept of arithmetic
operations: they can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided. Or perhaps
just some of these. We want to use the familiar binary arithmetic operators
(`+`, `-`, `*` and `/`) to work with these types, so that is the first thing
__Symbolism__ provides, though typeclass definitions for the four main arithmetic
operations, plus negation and square and cube root methods.
