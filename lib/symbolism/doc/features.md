- uses typeclasses as a modular way to implement symbolic operators
- avoids overloading errors when mixing different projects which define symbolic extension methods
- provides typeclasses for the arithmetic operators, `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`
- provides a single inequality typeclass for the comparison operators, `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=`
