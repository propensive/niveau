Bloom filters are useful when a _probabilistic_ answer for whether a set
contains a value is sufficient, particularly when the cost of storing every set
element is prohibitive. _Ulysses_ provides an immutable representation of a
Bloom filter, with flexibility to tune its properties according to need.
