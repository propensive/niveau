Git has become the _de facto_ version control system for programmers, but its
core API is its command line interface, designed with a shell user foremost in

usage. _Octogenarian_ is an attempt to provide a Git API in Scala, with all of
the capabilities available on the command-line, but presented through an
idiomatic API.
