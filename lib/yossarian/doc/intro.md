_Yossarian_ is a headless terminal emulator. It receives input, as a stream of
bytes, and interprets it to maintain the state of a terminal, of some size. In
particular, most standard any many common escape sequences will be interpreted
to modify the terminal's content (including colors and styles), cursor
position, and hyperlinks.
