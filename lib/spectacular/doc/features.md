- typeclass-based means of converting values to text
- defines the `Show` typeclass for text destined for end users
- defines the `Debug` typeclass for text destined for the developer
- extension methods `show` and `debug` will apply conversions using these typeclasses
- the `show` method may fail if a `Show` is not available
- the `debug` method will fall back to a `Show` method and then `toString` if no `Debug` instance exists
- `Debug` instances are generically derived for products and coproducts
