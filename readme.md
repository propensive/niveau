# Zeppelin

____

_Zeppelin_ makes it easy to work with ZIP files in Scala, providing methods for efficiently reading
and writing files within a ZIP archive, in a streaming or random access style.

## Features

- provides methods for reading and writing ZIP files
- integrates seamlessly with any file representations
- both streaming and random-access APIs are provided
- integrates directly with Turbulence readable and writable types


## Availability

Zeppelin has not yet been published as a binary.

## Getting Started

### Creating a ZIP file

A ZIP file can be constructed from an existing file by passing it to the `ZipFile` constructor.
Provided there is an appropriate `GenericPathReader` and `GenericPathMaker` (from
[Anticipation](https://github.com/propensive/anticipation)) in scope, any file representation (such
as `java.io.File`) may be used. For example,
```scala
import zeppelin.*
import diuretic.*
val file: java.io.File = java.io.File("/home/work/data.zip")
val zip = ZipFile(file)
```
or,
```scala
import zeppelin.*
import anticipation.fileApi.galileiApi
val file: galilei.DiskPath = Unix / p"home" / p"work" / p"data.zip"
val zip = ZipFile(file)
```

`ZipFile` provides several methods for working with the file.

#### Reading entries from a ZIP file

To read every entry from a `ZipFile`, call `ZipFile#entries()`. This will return a `LazyList[ZipEntry]`, a stream
of `ZipEntry`s in the order they are stored within the file, each one consisting of a `Relative` path (relative to
the root of the ZIP file) and a method to get its contents.

`ZipEntry`s support [Turbulence](https://github.com/propensive/turbulence/)'s `Readable` interface, so they can be
read as any type for which an `Aggregable` instance exists.

#### Appending files to an existing ZIP file

To add additional entries to a `ZipFile`, use `ZipFile#append`, which takes a
`LazyList` of `ZipEntry`s to append.

This method includes two additional parameters: a `prefix`, a `Bytes`
(`IArray[Byte]`) value to be inserted in raw form at the start of the ZIP file,
typically used to make the ZIP file executable; and a `timestamp` value for
specifying the timestamp of each entry appended to the ZIP file. If no
`timestamp` is specified, the current time will be used.



## Status

Zeppelin is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Zeppelin is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 174 lines of code.

## Building

Zeppelin can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Zeppelin are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked
<a href="https://github.com/propensive/zeppelin/labels/beginner">beginner</a>.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Zeppelin easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Author

Zeppelin was designed and developed by Jon Pretty, and commercial support and training is available from
[Propensive O&Uuml;](https://propensive.com/).



## Name

Like a ZIP file, a zeppelin airship may be inflated or deflated, and the name furthermore is an allusion to _zip_ping.

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
