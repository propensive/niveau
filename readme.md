# Serpentine

__Precise navigation of paths__

__Serpentine__ is a small library for handling the abstract notion of paths, distinguishing between
relative and absolute forms, rooted on some value. This may be useful for representing paths on a
filesystem, resources on an HTTP server, descendants in a family tree, or many other concepts which
follow a hierarchical pattern.

## Features

- representations of hierarchical paths
- designed for extension and use in many concrete contexts
- distinguishes between absolute and relative paths

## Availability

Serpentine has not yet been published as a binary.

## Getting Started

The type `Root` defines a "root", beneath which any number of possible `Path` instances may exist in
a hierarchy, and the methods `parent`, `ancestor` and `/` may be used to navigate between them. For
abstract paths, the value `Base` can serve as a root node for a path hierarchy.

Here are some examples:
```scala
val crustaceans = Base / "eukaryota" / "animalia" / "arthropods" / "crustaceans"
val arthropods = crustaceans.parent
val animalia = crustaceans.ancestor(2)
```

`Path`s may be further distinguished as `Path.Relative` or `Path.Absolute`, where a `Relative` may
be converted into an `Absolute` by calling the `Path#absolute` method, and passing an absolute path
to which the relative path should be considered relative to. The result is typed as `Path.Absolute`.

`Path` objects, whether absolute or relative, serialize with `toString` according to the delimiters
in their root, which are defined in terms of a base name (for example, `/` or `classpath:`) and a
separator (for example, `\`, `/` or `.`).

Any implementation of `Root` should define these values, `prefix` and `separator`, respectively. For
example, the definition,
```scala
object Domain extends Root(prefix = "", separator = ".")
```
would ensure that,
```scala
Domain / "www" / "example" / "com"
```
would serialize to the string `"www.example.com"`.

Note that the `separator` is not included between the `prefix` and the first path element when
serializing, so _may_ need to be included in the `prefix` value itself.

### Other Methods

The method `++` can add a `Relative` path to an `Absolute` path, and return a new `Absolute` path.

Similarly, `Absolute#relativeTo` takes another `Absolute` path and returns a `Relative` instance
that, when applied with `++` to the first path, produces the second path.

The `Absolute#conjunction` method will find the closest common parent of the path and its parameter.

Note that `Path`s are not aware of their children, so there is no `children` method, but this may be
provided by individual implementations.

### Exceptions

Many operations on `Path`s may attempt (directly or indirectly) to access the parent of the root.
This is not possible, and if this happens, a `RootBoundaryExceeded` exception will be thrown.

### Generic relative paths

Given that a relative path is (by definition) not attached to any particular root, all instances of
`Root#Path.Relative` inherit from `GenericRelative` which gives users the choice, when implementing
APIs that accept relative paths, between accepting _any_ kind of relative path (regardless of its
origin) and accepting just those originating from a particular root.



## Status

Serpentine is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Serpentine is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 482 lines of code.

## Building

Serpentine can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Serpentine are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked
<a href="https://github.com/propensive/serpentine/labels/beginner">beginner</a>.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Serpentine easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Name

A path which is _serpentine_ may be a challenge to navigate, which is where _Serpentine_ can help.

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
