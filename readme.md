# Profanity

__A library for realtime interactive terminal software__

_Profanity_ makes it possible to write real-time applications that interact through the terminal by
converting STDIN into an event stream of keypresses.

## Features

- capture a TTY terminal's individual keypresses
- interprets standard keys and control keys
- simple interactive line editor supporting standard keypresses
- simple interactive navigable menu


## Availability

Profanity has not yet been published as a binary.

## Getting Started

Java does not provide native support for direct access to keypress events. While Standard input (`STDIN`)
is accessible as an input stream, it is buffered until a newline is sent, which makes it impossible for a
Scala application to respond immediately to a keypress event, unless that keypress is the `Enter` key.

Profanity uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) to turn off buffering so that each keypress is received as
soon as it happens.

### Capturing the TTY

Before keypresses can be streamed as events, the TTY must be "captured". This is as simple as,
```scala
Tty.capture {
  // TTY operations are available here
}
```
but may not always succeed, for example if the JVM is not running inside a TTY, or if the TTY has already
been captured, or if the JNI calls fail for another reason. These exceptions are checked.

### Streaming keypresses

Within a `Tty.capture` block, a contextual `Tty` instance is made available, and `Tty.stream` can be
called which will, by default, return a `LazyList[Keypress]`, where `Keypress` is Profanity's standard
representation of a keypress event. `Keypress` is an enumeration providing the following cases:
- `Printable(c: Char)`, a keypress of a printable character, for example, `Shift+T` is `Printable('T')`
- `Function(i: Int)`, a function key keypress, where `i` is the function key number, for example `F2` is `Function(2)`
- `Ctrl(c: Char)`, a key combination of `Ctrl` and another character, for example, `Ctrl+C` is `Ctrl('c')`
- a keypress of one of the following keys: `Enter`, `Escape`, `Tab`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, `PageUp`,
  `PageDown`, `LeftArrow`, `RightArrow`, `UpArrow`, `DownArrow`, `CtrlLeftArrow`, `CtrlRightArrow`,
  `CtrlUpArrow`, `CtrlDownArrow`, `End`, `Home`, `Insert`
- `Escape(bytes: Byte*)`, any other escape sequence that hasn't been identified as one of the above

Additionally, the `Resize(rows: Int, cols: Int)` case represents the escape sequence that reports
the width and height of the console, and may be triggered by calling the `Tty.reportSize()`, or when a
`SIGWINCH` event occurs, i.e. when the terminal window's size changes. So a `Resize` event can be handled
just like a keypress event, where an action make be taken to ignore the event or redraw the screen, or
something else.

#### Alternative keyboards

`Tty.stream` takes an optional type parameter, `K`, which determines the type used to represent keypress events,
by resolving a contextual `Keyboard[K]` instance that interprets the bytes arriving in `STDIN` (either
individually, or as short sequences) as instances of `K`.

By default, only a single `Keyboard` given instance is defined, parameterized on the event type, `Keypress`,
which means that `Tty.stream` may be invoked without specifying its type parameter. Nevertheless, it is
possible to define alternative interpreters for the byte input to `STDIN`.

### Line Editor

Profanity provides a simple line editor that may be used inside a `Tty.capture` block, and will handle
common keypresses that may be used inside an editable field, including printable characters, arrow keys,
`Ctrl` key combinations such as `Ctrl+W` (delete word) and `Ctrl+U` (delete line).

This can be invoked inside a `Tty.capture` block with `LineEditor.ask()`, or pre-filled with an initial
value, `LineEditor.ask("initial")`.

#### Rendering

It is also possible to control how the line editor displays the text by overriding the default `render`
method of `LineEditor.ask`. This parameter is a `String => String` lambda, mapping from the current
value (i.e. the accumulation of several keypresses into a string) to the value that should be printed.

While `render` would normally use the identity function, it is possible to use the `LineEditor.concealed`
method to display each character as an `*` or even to include ANSI escape characters (e.g. from
[Escapade](https://github.com/propensive/escapade)) in the string. It is executed, and the line is
redrawn, for every keypress.

### Menus

A simple menu of two or more options is provided through the `SelectMenu` object. Its `ask` method,
which can only be called inside a `Tty.capture` block, will present a set of options to the user, of
which exactly one must be chosen using the arrow keys and the `Enter` key. In addition to the list of
choices being supplied as the first parameter of `SelectMenu.ask`, the initially-selected value may be
provided as the second.

Additionally, two lambdas, `renderOn` and `renderOff`, allow the rendering of each menu item (whether
_on_ or _off_) to be specified.

### Limitations

Profanity does not currently support Windows.



## Status

Profanity is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Profanity is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 317 lines of code.

## Building

Profanity can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Profanity are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked
<a href="https://github.com/propensive/profanity/labels/beginner">beginner</a>.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Profanity easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Name

A __profanity__ is an expletive or curse-word, and _Profanity_ imitates many of the features of the popular terminal library, Curses.

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
