# Punctuation

__Typesafe parsing and rendering of markdown__

_Punctuation_ provides a convenient representation of Markdown which disambiguates between inline-
and block-level content, with converters to
[Honeycomb](https://github.com/propensive/honeycomb) HTML and
[Escapade](https://github.com/propensive/escapade) ANSI-rendered text.

## Features

- parse Markdown content
- use different types for inline- and block-level content
- static typechecking of Markdown using interpolated strings
- support for substitutions of different types as formatted Markdown
- simple Scala AST representing Markdown
- convert inline- or block-level Markdown to HTML (using Honeycomb)
- convert Markdown to styled ANSI terminal text (using Escapade)


## Availability

Punctuation has not yet been published as a binary.

## Getting Started

Markdown may be read from a source such as a string or file with the `Markdown.parse` method. For example,
```scala
import punctuation.*
val md = Markdown.parse(t"## This is a subheading")
```
will return an instance of `Markdown[Block]`, which is a wrapper for a sequence of block-level Markdown
AST elements. In the example above, the result would be equal to,
`Markdown(Heading(2, Textual(t"This is a subheading")))`.

Block-level AST elements are:
- `ThematicBreak()`
- `Paragraph(inline*)`
- `Heading(level, inline*)`
- `FencedCode(lang, meta, text)`
- `BulletList(numbered, loose, items*)`
- `BlockQuote(block*)`
- `Reference(id, location)`
- `Table(parts*)`

Using [Honeycomb](https://github.com/propensive/honeycomb/) a `Markdown[Block]` instance may be converted
to HTML just by calling the `html` extension method on it. This extension method returns an instance of
`Seq[Html[Flow]].

### Inline Markdown

Often block-level Markdown elements are not desired, and the subset of Markdown that is valid in "inline"
contexts is required. The `Markdown.parseInline` method will parse an inline fragment of Markdown, returning
an instance of `Markdown[Inline]`.

Inline AST elements are:
- `Break()`
- `Emphasis(inline*)`
- `HtmlNode(text)`
- `Image(alt, src)`
- `Code(text)`
- `Strong(inline*)`
- `Textual(text)`
- `Link(location, inline*)`

Likewise, a `Markdown[Inline]` instance can be converted to HTML with the `html` extension method. Since
inline Markdown uses a more limited set of HTML tags, this method returns a `Seq[Html[Phrasing]]` which
allows it to be embedded within nodes such as `P`, which would not be the case for block-level Markdown
converted to HTML.

### `md""` Interpolator

In addition to parsing Markdown at runtime, it's possible to construct Markdown literals with the `md""`
interpolator. This is as simple as writing markdown inside quotes preceded by `md`, and it will be
parsed at compiletime. For example, `md"This is _emphasised_."`

The type of a `md""` literal will depend upon its content. If it includes block-level elements, its
return type will be `Markdown[Block]`, whereas if it uses only inline elements, it will be typed as
`Markdown[Inline]`.

Any errors in the Markdown content will be detected at compiletime, causing compile errors.

Substitutions into Markdown literals are also supported, provided the type of the substitution can be
converted to Markdown, and can appear at the position it's substituted. Conversion of a particular type
to Markdown is permitted by the existence of a contextual typeclass instance.



## Status

Punctuation is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Punctuation is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 593 lines of code.

## Building

Punctuation can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Punctuation are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked
<a href="https://github.com/propensive/punctuation/labels/beginner">beginner</a>.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Punctuation easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

Punctuation was designed and developed by Jon Pretty, and commercial support and training is available from

## Name

To _punctuate_ is "to mark with points" (or more specifically, symbolic characters) and also, "to stress or single out as important", which describes Markdown in both the literal sense that punctuation characters are added to text, and in the figurative sense that this punctuates a document with stress and other styled emphasis.

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
