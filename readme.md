# Umbrageous

____

Shading a package, effectively renaming it, is one way to avoid conflicts
between packages with the same name. This is a scenario which frequently arises
in complex builts which include transitive dependencies on different versions
of the same library (often called the "diamond dependency problem").

Normally shading is performed on a binary after compilation, but this is slow
and can introduce new problems.  Umbrageous is a compiler plugin which makes it
trivial to compile a library into a package with a distinct prefix without
modifying its source code.

## Features

- rewrites package names at compiletime
- adds no time to the build process
- avoids the need to modify source code
- avoids slow bytecode rewriting after compilation
- customizable with compiler parameters; no configuration files required
- automatically unshades shaded packages in downstream compilations


## Availability

Umbrageous has not yet been published as a binary. It is currently waiting for the
final release of Scala 3.3.

## Getting Started

To use Umbrageous, `scalac` must be invoked with two additional parameters:
```sh
scalac -d bin -Xplugin:umbrageous.jar -P:umbrageous:com.example:shaded *.scala`
```

Firstly, `-Xplugin:umbrageous.jar` points the compiler to a JAR file containing
the packaged plugin.

Secondly, `-P:umbrageous:com.example:shaded` tells the plugin to shade
everything inside the `com.example` package behind the prefix `shaded`, i.e.
rewriting `com.example` to `shaded.com.example`.

This `-P` parameter can be provided multiple times to shade different packages.
If more than one parameter matches a package name (e.g.
`-P:umbrageous:com:shade1` and `-P:umbrageous:com.example:shade2`) then the
prefix corresponding to the longest match will be applied to that package.

A downstream project can include an additional wildcard import at the start to
include everything from its shaded dependencies, for example,
```scala
package myproject
import shade.*  // additional import
import com.example
```
will allow the shaded `com.example` package (shaded by the `shade` prefix)
resolve anywhere in the scope of the import (whether imported, or referred to
by fully-qualified classname).

Including the parameter, `-P:umbrageous:com.example:shade` will automatically
unshade the `com.example` package from subsequent compilations without the need
for the import.

Note that this parameter is the same whether applying or using shading.
However, caution should be taken to avoid including nonexistant shaded
packages: doing so will add the synthetic wildcard import, but it will not
resolve, and a compile error will result.

### Limitations

Umbrageous does not currently match package names that are defined in multiple
`package` declarations, such as `com.example` in:

```scala
package com
package example

object Main // ...
```

Additionally, code which references an absolute name, such as
`_root_.com.example.Main` will not find the entity with its new, shaded name.



## Status

Umbrageous is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Umbrageous is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 46 lines of code.

## Building

Umbrageous can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Umbrageous are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Umbrageous easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Name

Plants which are umbrageous provide shade from light, and _Umbrageous_ shades Scala packages.

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
