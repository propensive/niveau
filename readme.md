## Status

Punctuation is classified as __fledgling__. Propensive defines the following five stability levels for open-source projects:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

## Name

To _punctuate_ is "to mark with points" (or more specifically, symbolic characters) and also, "to
stress or single out as important", which describes Markdown in both the literal sense that
punctuation characters are added to text, and in the figurative sense that this punctuates a
document with stress and other styled emphasis.
