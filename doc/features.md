- statically checks that physical quantities have consistent units by making them distinct types
- `Quantity` values encode the (nonzero) power of each unit in their type
- all `Quantity`s are opaque aliases of `Double`, so are stored and processed efficiently
- enforces homogeneous units for all additions and subtractions
- calculates resultant units for multiplications and divisions
- unitless values are seamlessly represented by `Double`s
- distinguishes between _dimensions_ (such as length or mass) and _units_ (such as metres or feet)
- different units of the same dimension may be combined
- convertions between different units of the same dimension
- requires no new or special syntax
- fully extensible: new units, dimensions and conversions can be introduced
- provides implementations of base and most derived SI units
