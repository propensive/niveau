- provides support for record types in Scala
- enforces namespace-safety on field access
- record schemas may be defined programmatically, without writing explicit case classes
- schemas can be defined dynamically, taking strings as field names
- schemas may be defined in the same module, provided they are not used in the same file
- uses Scala 3's `Selectable` trait internally
