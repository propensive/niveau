__Serpentine__ is a small library for handling the abstract notion of paths, distinguishing between
relative and absolute forms, rooted on some value. This may be useful for representing paths on a
filesystem, resources on an HTTP server, descendants in a family tree, or many other concepts which
follow a hierarchical pattern.
