__Probably__ is a testing library designed to unintrusively provide test recording and reporting capabilities to any
codebase, regardless of the users&rsquo; choices of libraries or programming paradigms. __Probably__ can define and run
unit tests and property tests. Its syntax is simple and unexciting, and its execution model has zero magic:
it&rsquo;s the same as for any other program.
